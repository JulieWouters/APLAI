How to run the Sudoku solutions
---------------------------------

In ECLiPSe:

All solutions are contained in the "sudoku_ecl.pl" file.
Use the predicate solve(P,B,Method) to solve a specific given puzzle P 
(P can be either the name of a puzzle or a number going from 1 to 18).
B is the amount of backtracks needed to solve the puzzle
and Method is the heuristic used (first_fail, input_order, occurrence or most_constrained).
This predicate is used to obtain the solution with channeling.
When you want to get the solution using the original/new viewpoint,
you can use the predicate solve([original],P,B) or solve([new],P,B), respectively.

The sudoku solution will be printed.

In CHR:

Solution with original viewpoint is in "sudoku_chr_or.pl",
solution with new viewpoint is in "sudoku_chr_new.pl"
and solution with channeling is in "sudoku_chr_chan.pl".

In all these files, use the predicate solve(P,firstfail) to use the first fail heuristic
and solve(P,inputorder) to use the input order heuristic.
Again, P can be either the name or number of a puzzle.

The predicate solve solves all puzzles after each other (using firstfail).

The sudoku solution will be printed (as well as the backtracks, represented by the amount of B's).
